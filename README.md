AI-Based Fake Job Post Detection System

An AI-powered application designed to identify and classify fraudulent job postings using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP). This system helps users distinguish between genuine and fake job listings, improving safety and trust in online recruitment platforms.
Project Overview:

With the rapid growth of online job portals, fraudulent job postings have become increasingly common. This project analyzes job descriptions to detect scam indicators such as misleading language, unrealistic salary claims, and suspicious requirements.

The system processes job post text, extracts meaningful features, and applies machine learning models to predict whether a job post is real or fake.
 Key Features:
 Detects fake and genuine job postings
 NLP-based text preprocessing and analysis
 Machine learning classification
 User-friendly web interface
 Real-time prediction results

 Tech Stack:

Programming Language: Python

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn

NLP: Text preprocessing, TF-IDF

Backend: Flask / FastAPI

Frontend: Streamlit

Database: MongoDB / PostgreSQL

How It Works :

User inputs a job description

Text is cleaned and preprocessed using NLP techniques

Features are extracted using TF-IDF

A trained ML model classifies the job post

The result (Fake / Genuine) is displayed to the user

Future Enhancements
