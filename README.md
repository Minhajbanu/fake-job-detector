🔍 AI-Based Fake Job Post Detection System

An AI-powered application designed to identify and classify fraudulent job postings using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP). This system helps users distinguish between genuine and fake job listings, improving safety and trust in online recruitment platforms.
📌 Project Overview

With the rapid growth of online job portals, fraudulent job postings have become increasingly common. This project analyzes job descriptions to detect scam indicators such as misleading language, unrealistic salary claims, and suspicious requirements.

The system processes job post text, extracts meaningful features, and applies machine learning models to predict whether a job post is real or fake.
